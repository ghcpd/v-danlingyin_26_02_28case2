Before any development or refactor work, we need to understand the intended semantics.\\n\\n## Observed Ambiguity\\n\\nThe implementation is a placeholder with no comments. The README for the service does not mention this function. There are no unit or integration tests covering `processSubscription` to infer its responsibilities. As a result, multiple aspects of its operation are unclear.\\n\\n## Specific Clarification Questions\\n\\n1. **Charging semantics**\\n   - Does calling `processSubscription` immediately bill the provided `userId` for the `planId`, or is billing deferred until a later step?\\n\\n2. **Subscription state**\\n   - Should this function create a subscription record in an active state, or mark it as pending/awaiting payment confirmation?\\n\\n3. **Trials and promotional periods**\\n   - How are trial plans handled? Should `processSubscription` automatically apply trial logic or delegate to another process?\\n\\n4. **Existing subscriptions**\\n   - What should happen if the user already has an active or pending subscription? Should the function reject, upgrade, queue a change, or silently ignore the request?\\n\\n5. **Idempotency**\\n   - Is the function expected to be idempotent (i.e. safe to call multiple times with the same arguments)? If so, how should duplicates be detected and handled?\\n\\n6. **Error conditions**\\n   - What errors should be thrown or returned for invalid input (e.g., nonexistent user/plan, payment failures)?\\n\\n## Risk of Proceeding Without Clarification\\n\\n- **Data inconsistency**: Implementing assumptions could result in duplicate charges, incorrect subscription states, or lost transactions.\\n- **Billing issues**: Charging users unexpectedly or failing to charge when due can lead to revenue loss and user complaints.\\n- **Regulatory/compliance**: Mishandling trial periods or subscription cancellations may violate regulations or terms of service.\\n- **Technical debt**: Incorrect behavior would require rework once the true requirements are discovered, complicating future development.\\n\\n## Suggested Documentation Improvements\\n\\n- Add explicit documentation for `processSubscription` in the README or a dedicated service docs file detailing its contract, side effects, and interactions.\\n- Provide comprehensive unit and integration tests covering normal flows, edge cases (existing subscriptions, trials, errors), and idempotency guarantees.\\n- Include inline comments or a docstring in `subscription.ts` explaining the expected behavior, preconditions, postconditions, and error handling.\\n\\n---\\n\\nPlease review the questions above so that the
