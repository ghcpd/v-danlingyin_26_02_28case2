Background\\nThe repository contains a `SubscriptionService` with a function:\\n\\n```ts\\nprocessSubscription(userId: string, planId: string)\\n```\\n\\nThis function is currently a stub (`// TODO: implement subscription logic`) and there is no documentation in the README, source comments, or existing tests that explain its intended behavior.\\n\\n## 2. Observed Ambiguity\\nWhile inspecting the codebase, the following uncertainties were identified:\\n\\n- It is not clear whether `processSubscription` should immediately charge the user or simply create a subscription record.\\n- There is no visible mechanism for handling trial plans (if they exist), trial periods, or trial-to-paid transitions.\\n- The behavior when a user already has an active subscription is undefined.\\n- It is unknown whether the function is expected to be idempotent (safe to call multiple times with the same inputs).\\n\\n## 3. Specific Clarification Questions\\n1. **Intent & Scope**\\n   1.1. Should `processSubscription` perform an immediate payment capture/charge, or only create/update a subscription record and defer payment processing to another service?  \\n   1.2. Is this function responsible for interacting with an external billing gateway (Stripe, PayPal, etc.), or is that handled elsewhere?\\n\\n2. **Trial Plans**\\n   2.1. Are there subscription plans that include a trial period?  \\n   2.2. If so, should `processSubscription` create a trial state (e.g., `trialing`) without charging, and if so, how is the trial duration defined?  \\n   2.3. What should happen when a trial ends—does this function need to schedule a transition or notify another process?\\n\\n3. **Existing Active Subscription**\\n   3.1. What is the expected behavior if `userId` already has an active subscription?  \\n   3.2. Should `processSubscription` reject the request, replace the existing subscription, extend it, or create a separate subscription record?  \\n   3.3. Are there specific status values (e.g., `active`, `paused`, `cancelled`) that the service must enforce when updating an existing subscription?\\n\\n4. **Idempotency & Safe Re-tries**\\n   4.1. Is `processSubscription` expected to be idempotent when called multiple times with the same `userId` and `planId`?  \\n   4.2. If called repeatedly (e.g., due to retries in an asynchronous workflow), should it return the same result, no-op, or produce an error?\\n\\n## 4. Risk of Proceeding Without Clarification\\n- Implementing the function without clear requirements could lead to incorrect billing behavior (e.g., double charges or missed charges).\\n- Misinterpreting trial logic could result in unauthorized access to paid features or accidental revenue loss.\\n- Undefined behavior for existing subscriptions may cause data corruption, inconsistent user state, or billing disputes.\\n- Without idempotency guarantees, retry logic in higher-level workflows may cause duplicate side effects.\\n\\n## 5. Suggested Documentation Improvements\\n- Add a section to the README (or dedicated design doc) describing the subscription lifecycle, including:\\n  - What `processSubscription` is responsible for (billing, record creation, status transitions).\\n  - How trial plans are represented and handled.\\n  - Expected state transitions for existing subscriptions (e.g., upgrade, downgrade, renew).\\n- Add unit/integration tests that codify the expected behavior for:\\n  - New subscription creation (paid vs trial)\\n  - Re-processing an existing subscription request\\n  - Handling of invalid or conflicting states\\n  - Idempotency expectations\\n\"}","id":"call_o60tbNsjQpV9kFLs9m1tzLzM__vscode-1772263057062"}],"toolInputRetry":0,"id":"43685926-b66e-4c00-8e92-200faf20abe2","statefulMarker":"resp_03ea062602a190e20069a296ffd3ec819095229df8c806145b","thinking":{"id":"rs_03ea062602a190e20069a2970118888190b679a623858b66c4","text":"**Creating clarification request file**\n\nI need to create a file named CLARIFICATION_REQUEST.md in the current directory.
