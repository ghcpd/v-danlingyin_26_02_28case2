Background\\n\\nWhile working in this repository, I found a service called `SubscriptionService` that exposes a function:\\n\\n```ts\\nprocessSubscription(userId: string, planId: string)\\n```\\n\\nThe repository currently lacks documentation, comments, or tests that clarify what this function is expected to do. Before making any modifications (e.g., implementing this function, adding a feature, or writing tests), I need explicit guidance on the intended behavior.\\n\\n## 2. Observed Ambiguity\\n\\nThe existing codebase provides no observable contract for `processSubscription`. The following aspects are unclear and have multiple plausible interpretations:\\n\\n- Whether `processSubscription` performs a **real-time charge** (immediately bills the user) or merely **creates/updates a record** (e.g., a pending subscription or subscription request).\\n- How **trial plans** should be handled (e.g., activate immediately with delayed billing, create a trial record, or require explicit activation).\\n- How the function behaves when a **user already has an active subscription** (e.g., upgrade/downgrade, reject, extend, or create a new subscription alongside an existing one).\\n- Whether the function is supposed to be **idempotent** (safe to call multiple times with the same inputs without causing duplicated charges or multiple records).\\n\\n## 3. Specific Clarification Questions\\n\\n### 3.1 Payment and Billing Behavior\\n1. Does `processSubscription` **initiate an immediate charge** for the given plan (e.g., call payment gateway APIs, capture payment) or does it only **record the intent** to subscribe (e.g., create a pending order that is charged later)?\\n2. If it does charge immediately, how are **payment failures** supposed to be handled (retry, mark as failed, roll back state)?\\n3. If it does _not_ charge immediately, what is the expected downstream process that finalizes payment? Is there a separate job/service that picks up pending subscriptions?\\n\\n### 3.2 Trial Plans\\n4. How should **trial plans** be treated? Specifically:\\n   - Should the user receive an active subscription immediately with a trial period (and billing postponed)?\\n   - Should the user’s subscription be created in a “pending trial” state, requiring an explicit activation step?\\n   - Are there any assumptions about how trial eligibility is determined (e.g., first-time users only)?\\n\\n### 3.3 Existing Active Subscriptions\\n5. What should happen if the `userId` already has an **active subscription**?\\n   - Should `processSubscription` deny the request, return an error, or allow switching plans?\\n   - If switching plans is allowed, should it **prorate** the remaining period, extend the current subscription, or replace it immediately?\\n   - Should there be safeguards to prevent multiple overlapping active subscriptions for the same user?\\n\\n### 3.4 Idempotency and Retry Behavior\\n6. Is `processSubscription` intended to be **idempotent**? In other words, if it is called multiple times with the same `userId` and `planId`, should it:\\n   - Return the same result without creating duplicates,\\n   - Reject duplicate requests,\\n   - Or create new subscription records each time?\\n7. If there is an internal workflow that may retry the operation (e.g., due to transient failures), what is the expected behavior when the same request is retried?\\n\\n## 4. Risk of Proceeding Without Clarification\\n\\nProceeding without clear guidance could lead to several risks:\\n\\n- **Billing errors**: Charging customers incorrectly (double charges, immediate charges instead of trial activation, etc.).\\n- **Data inconsistency**: Creating duplicate or overlapping subscriptions, causing downstream processes (billing, access control) to behave incorrectly.\\n- **Customer-impacting regressions**: Changes made under incorrect assumptions could break existing users’ subscriptions and lead to support incidents.\\n- **Test coverage gaps**: Without agreed-upon expected behavior, tests may assert the wrong contract and give a false sense of safety.\\n\\n## 5. Suggested Documentation Improvements\\n\\nTo avoid similar ambiguity in the future, it would be helpful to add the following:\\n\\n- **README section** or **API documentation** for `SubscriptionService` that describes the intended subscription workflow, including how billing, trials, and plan changes are handled.\\n- **Inline comments** in the implementation (or interface) that clearly define the expected effects and side effects of `processSubscription`.\\n- **Unit/integration tests** that explicitly cover:\\n  - successful subscription creation (paid and trial plans),\\n  - behavior when a user already has an active subscription,\\n  - idempotency guarantees (or lack thereof),\\n  - failure cases (payment failure, invalid planId, etc.).\\n\\n---\\n\\nPlease advise on the intended contract for `processSubscription(userId, planId)` so that I can implement or extend it correctly and safely.\"}","id":"call_Jw3jqPoAEsiyCxxA1zr9zvSD__vscode-1772263023106"}],"toolInputRetry":0,"id":"3d902994-20e1-40f9-be16-8c068f5cd66c","statefulMarker":"resp_0e2cd579c8e004290069a296ffc27c8196b83aeec9f585d59e","thinking":{"id":"rs_0e2cd579c8e004290069a29700ef84819691a834b097e0c7e1","text":"**Creating clarification request**\n\nI'm planning to create a file called CLARIFICATION_REQUEST.md in the directory using the create_file tool.
