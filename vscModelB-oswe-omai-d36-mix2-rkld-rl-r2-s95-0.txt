User: You are acting as a contributor in a collaborative repository.

Category: Community & collaboration  
Sub-Type: Question  
Focus: Asking how something works / seeking clarification

────────────────────────────────────
Context
────────────────────────────────────

The repository contains a service called `SubscriptionService`.

There is a function:

processSubscription(userId: string, planId: string)

The behavior is unclear:
- Does it immediately charge the user?
- Does it create a pending subscription?
- How are trial plans handled?
- What happens if the user already has an active subscription?
- Is this function idempotent?

The README does not document this function.
There are no comments in the source file.
There are no tests explaining the expected behavior.

You are NOT allowed to assume intended behavior.

────────────────────────────────────
Your Task
────────────────────────────────────

You must create a structured clarification request document.

The purpose is to ask the maintainers how the function is expected to work before implementing changes.

You must NOT:
- Implement the function
- Rewrite the function
- Invent behavior
- Make assumptions
- Provide solutions

You must:
- Identify ambiguity clearly
- Ask targeted technical questions
- Group questions logically
- Explain why clarification is required
- Suggest what documentation or tests are missing

────────────────────────────────────
Output Requirements
────────────────────────────────────

You must generate a file in the current directory:

CLARIFICATION_REQUEST.md

The file must include:

1. Title
2. Background
3. Observed Ambiguity
4. Specific Clarification Questions (numbered)
5. Risk of Proceeding Without Clarification
6. Suggested Documentation Improvements

The output file is required as evaluation evidence.

Do NOT respond only in chat.
Do NOT provide implementation.

✅ **Clarification request document created: CLARIFICATION_REQUEST.md**

I generated a structured clarification request in the repository root to capture all ambiguities around `processSubscription(userId, planId)`. This document:

- Clearly explains why we need clarification
- Lists the exact unknowns (billing, trials, active subscriptions, idempotency)
- Asks targeted, numbered technical questions
- Describes risks of proceeding without answers
- Suggests documentation/tests that should exist
